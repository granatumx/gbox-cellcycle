    This gbox provides the ability to create the G1, G2M, and S phases for cells as sample metadata.
  description: >
    Given logged and filtered data input, this GBOX can follow the tools provided by [Seurat](http://satijalab.org/seurat) and [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
    It employs the approach given in [Cell-Cycle Scoring and Regression](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy_usage/blob/master/180209_cell_cycle/cell_cycle.ipynb) with the updated gene lists provided by [Seurat v4.3](https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/cc.genes.html). Please cite all relevant references and observe the licenses provided by each of these packages.
